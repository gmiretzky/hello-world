# hello-world
My first repo test with github

This is a repo that i made using the GUI , according to the github hello-world manual
I had conflict since i change both master and readme-edit branches. Hope this will fix it. 

Added the script folder with the hello world script to the repo using the git clone command.

Adding more text using my centos machine . See if this will pushed successfuly.
